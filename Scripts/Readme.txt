## Clustering.py:
This Python script implements three popular dimensionality reduction techniques—UMAP, T-SNE, and PCA—to visualize high-dimensional biological data. The visualizations aim to reveal underlying patterns, relationships, and clusters in the data, which is particularly useful in clinical or genetic research.

The script allows users to:

- **Explore high-dimensional data**: Reduce complex datasets to 2D or 3D visualizations for easier interpretation.
- **Identify clusters or subgroups**: Visualize how different data points, such as clinical subgroups or disease categories, relate to each other.
- **Gain insights into the data**: Uncover hidden structures or patterns in the dataset, which can guide further analysis or hypothesis generation.


The script uses the following techniques:

- UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: A powerful dimensionality reduction technique that maintains both local and global structures in the data.
- T-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: A method that focuses on preserving the local structure of the data, often used for visualizing clusters.
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: A linear technique that projects the data into a new coordinate system based on its variance.
