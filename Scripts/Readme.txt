## Clustering.py

This Python script implements dimensionality reduction techniques—UMAP, T-SNE, and PCA—to visualize high-dimensional aCGH (array CGH) data for breast cancer subtype classification.
The visualizations aim to reveal underlying patterns and relationships within the data, providing insights into how different breast cancer subtypes—HER2 positive, Hormone receptor positive (HR+), 
and Triple negative (TN)—are distributed across the samples.
