## Clustering.py

This Python script implements dimensionality reduction techniques—UMAP, T-SNE, and PCA—to visualize high-dimensional aCGH (array CGH) data for breast cancer subtype classification.

The visualizations aim to reveal underlying patterns and relationships within the data, providing insights into how different breast cancer subtypes—HER2 positive, Hormone receptor positive (HR+), 
and Triple negative (TN)—are distributed across the samples.


## Evaluation.py

Python script for evaluating machine learning models on biological datasets, performing data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation 
(SVM, k-NN, Logistic Regression) with confusion matrix, ROC curve, and accuracy calculations.

## Feature Selection.py

contains a Python script for performing feature selection on clinical data from the CATS project. 
The script focuses on identifying the most relevant features from a dataset to aid in subsequent analysis and model development.

## Hyperparameter_Tuning.py

Contains Python script for hyperparameter tuning of SVM, k-NN, and Logistic Regression models using GridSearchCV, including feature selection and cross-validation, 
to identify optimal parameters and evaluate model performance.
